Enables [2mwt switch -[0m to return to the previous worktree, similar to [2mcd -[0m or [2mgit checkout -[0m.

[32mHow it works

Updated automatically on every [2mwt switch[0m. Stored in git config as [2mworktrunk.history[0m.

[32mWhen to use

Most users never need this command — the previous branch updates automatically.
Use it to:

- [1mDebug[0m — See what [2m-[0m resolves to
- [1mOverride[0m — Set a specific branch as "previous"
- [1mClear[0m — Reset the history

Without a subcommand, runs [2mget[0m.
