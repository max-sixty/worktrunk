Removes worktrees and their branches. Without arguments, removes the current worktree and returns to the main worktree.

[32mExamples[0m

Remove current worktree:

  [2mwt remove[0m

Remove specific worktrees:

  [2mwt remove feature-branch[0m
  [2mwt remove old-feature another-branch[0m

Keep the branch:

  [2mwt remove --no-delete-branch feature-branch[0m

Force-delete an unmerged branch:

  [2mwt remove -D experimental[0m

[32mBranch cleanup[0m

Branches delete automatically when their content is already in the target branch (typically main). This works with squash-merge and rebase workflows where commit history differs but file changes match.

Use [2m-D[0m to force-delete unmerged branches. Use [2m--no-delete-branch[0m to keep the branch.

[32mBackground removal[0m

Removal runs in the background by default (returns immediately). Logs are written to [2m.git/wt-logs/{branch}-remove.log[0m. Use [2m--no-background[0m to run in the foreground.

Arguments resolve by path first, then branch name—see wt switch. Shortcuts: [2m@[0m (current), [2m-[0m (previous), [2m^[0m (main worktree).
