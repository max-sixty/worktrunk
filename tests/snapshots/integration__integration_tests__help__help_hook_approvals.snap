[32mHow Approvals Work

Commands from project hooks ([2m.config/wt.toml[0m) and LLM configuration require
approval on first run. This prevents untrusted projects from running arbitrary
commands.

[1mApproval flow:
1. Command is shown with expanded template variables
2. User approves or denies
3. Approved commands are saved to user config under [2m[projects."project-id"]

[1mWhen re-approval is required:
- Command template changes (not just variable values)
- Project ID changes (repository moves)

[1mBypassing prompts:
- [2m--force[0m flag on individual commands (e.g., [2mwt merge --force[0m)
- Useful for CI/automation where prompts aren't possible

[32mExamples

Pre-approve all commands for current project:
  [2mwt hook approvals add

Clear approvals for current project:
  [2mwt hook approvals clear

Clear global approvals:
  [2mwt hook approvals clear --global
