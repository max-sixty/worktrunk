> **December 2025**: I've been using Worktrunk as my daily driver, and am releasing it as Open Source this week; I think folks will find it really helpful. It's built with love (there's no slop!). If social proof is helpful: I also created [PRQL](https://github.com/PRQL/prql) (10k stars) and am a maintainer of [Xarray](https://github.com/pydata/xarray) (4k stars), [Insta](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/insta), & [Numbagg](https://github.com/numbagg/numbagg).

Worktrunk is a CLI for git worktree management, designed for parallel AI agent workflows. Git worktrees give each agent an isolated branch and directory; Worktrunk adds branch-based navigation, unified status, and lifecycle hooks. Creating a new agent workspace is as immediate as `git switch`.

Here's a quick demo:

## Context: git worktrees

AI agents like Claude Code and Codex can handle longer tasks without supervision,
and running several in parallel is practical. Git worktrees give each agent its
own working directory — no stepping on each other's changes.

But the git worktree UX is clunky. Even starting a new worktree means typing the
branch name three times: `git worktree add -b feature ../repo.feature`, then
`cd ../repo.feature`.

## Worktrunk makes git worktrees easy

Start with the core commands; add workflow automation as needed.

**Core commands:**

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Task</th>
      <th>Worktrunk</th>
      <th>Plain git</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Switch worktrees</td>
      <td><code>wt switch feature</code></td>
      <td><pre>cd ../repo.feature</pre></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Create + start Claude</td>
      <td><code>wt switch -c -x claude feature</code></td>
      <td><pre>git worktree add -b feature ../repo.feature && \
cd ../repo.feature && \
claude</pre></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Clean up</td>
      <td><code>wt remove</code></td>
      <td><pre>cd ../repo && \
git worktree remove ../repo.feature && \
git branch -d feature</pre></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>List with status</td>
      <td><code>wt list</code></td>
      <td><pre>git worktree list</pre> (paths only)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

**Workflow automation:**

- **[Lifecycle hooks](https://worktrunk.dev/hook/)** — run commands on create, pre-merge, post-merge
- **[LLM commit messages](https://worktrunk.dev/llm-commits/)** — generate commit messages from diffs via [llm](https://llm.datasette.io/)
- **[Merge workflow](https://worktrunk.dev/merge/)** — squash, rebase, merge, clean up in one command
- ...and [lots more](#next-steps)

## Core commands in practice

Create a worktree for a new task:

<!-- ⚠️ AUTO-GENERATED from tests/integration_tests/snapshots/integration__integration_tests__shell_wrapper__tests__readme_example_simple_switch.snap — edit source to update -->

```bash
$ wt switch --create fix-auth
✅ Created new worktree for fix-auth from main at ../repo.fix-auth
```

<!-- END AUTO-GENERATED -->

Switch to an existing worktree:

<!-- ⚠️ AUTO-GENERATED from tests/integration_tests/snapshots/integration__integration_tests__shell_wrapper__tests__readme_example_switch_back.snap — edit source to update -->

```bash
$ wt switch feature-api
✅ Switched to worktree for feature-api at ../repo.feature-api
```

<!-- END AUTO-GENERATED -->

Clean up when done:

<!-- ⚠️ AUTO-GENERATED from tests/integration_tests/snapshots/integration__integration_tests__shell_wrapper__tests__readme_example_remove.snap — edit source to update -->

```console
$ wt remove
